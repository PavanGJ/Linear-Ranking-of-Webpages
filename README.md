Machine Learning Algorithms to perform Linear Regression & Clustering.
Originally written to perform Ranking of Webpages as a part of a course assignment. It involved applying the Radial Basis Function and
K-Means Clustering to perform <b>dimensionality reduction</b> and then apply Linear Regression algorithms to generate a fine-grained rank/rating of a
webpage.

## Description

Contains files to Perform Linear Regression utilizing Gradient Descent Algorithm and Closed Form Solutions.
Gradient Descent is implemented in two flavors : <b>Batch Gradient Descent</b> and <b>Stochastic Gradient Descent</b>

<b>K-Means Clustering</b> algorithm has been implemented under the Unsupervised Learning Algorithms.
Also this repository contains the algorithm for the <b>Gaussian Kernel</b> or <b>Radial Basis Function</b> kernel.

The dataprocessor.py is written to process data from the file and perform the Regression.
